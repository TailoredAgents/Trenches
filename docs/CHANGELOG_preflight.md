# Pre-flight Checkpoint (Telemetry + SSE)

## Summary
- executor: compute `slippage_bps_real` using quote vs. realized execution, store extra fill context for metrics.
- position-manager: track per-position MAE in basis points and persist on close.
- shared SSE helper: retry/backoff with Last-Event-ID; adopted in executor, safety-engine, onchain-discovery, policy-engine, position-manager, alpha-ranker, UI dashboard.
- config/env: ensure `features.rugGuard` and `execution.jitoEnabled` gate runtime behaviour; add service-port env placeholders.
- persistence: queue candidate writes and leader-wallet inserts via `createWriteQueue`.
- trainers: alpha/fillnet/rugguard scripts print basic validation stats and include them in exported models.

## Build & Test
- `pnpm -r build`
- `pnpm smoke:exec`
- `pnpm smoke:survival`
- `pnpm smoke:sizing`
- `pnpm smoke:pnl`
- `pnpm smoke:alpha`
- `pnpm smoke:fillnet`

## Notes
- SSE helper is opt-in via `createSSEClient` and maintains in-memory last-event IDs; services supply their own `EventSource` factory.
- No Phase F features (route quarantine, migration preset tweaks, leader wallet scoring, price updater) included in this checkpoint.

# Exit Strategy Mathematical Analysis

## Current Configuration
```yaml
multiplierPercents: [100, 300, 800, 2000]  # Exit levels: 100%, 300%, 800%, 2000%
takeProfits: [1.5, 2, 3, 5]                # Exit percentages: 15%, 20%, 25%, 40%
```

## Current Exit Strategy Breakdown

### Exit Schedule
- **100% gain**: Exit 15% of position → Keep 85%
- **300% gain**: Exit 20% of remaining → Keep 68%  
- **800% gain**: Exit 25% of remaining → Keep 51%
- **2000% gain**: Exit 40% of remaining → Keep 30.6%

### Mathematical Analysis

#### Scenario 1: Token goes to 100% and stops
- **Position**: 100% → **Exit**: 15% at 2x = **30% gain**
- **Remaining**: 85% holds → **Loss when it crashes**: -85%
- **Net Result**: 30% - 85% = **-55% LOSS**

#### Scenario 2: Token goes to 120% and stops  
- **Position**: 100% → **Exit**: 15% at 2x = **30% gain**
- **Remaining**: 85% at 2.2x = **102% gain**
- **Net Result**: 30% + 102% = **+132% gain** ✅

#### Scenario 3: Token goes to 80% and stops
- **Position**: 100% → **No exits triggered**
- **Net Result**: **-20% to -35%** (depending on stop loss)

### Break-Even Analysis

**Current strategy breaks even when**:
- 15% exit at 100% gain = +30% on that portion
- Need remaining 85% to not lose more than 30%
- **Break-even point**: Token must reach **~130-140%** to be profitable

### Problem Identified ⚠️

**The current strategy is NOT profitable for 80-120% gains!**

- **80% gains**: Lose money (no exits triggered)
- **100% gains**: Lose significant money (-55%)
- **Only profitable at 130%+**

This means we need **at least 70% of tokens to reach 130%+** to be profitable overall.

## Recommended New Strategy

### Strategy 1: Early Profit Lock (Conservative-Aggressive)
```yaml
multiplierPercents: [50, 100, 200, 500]    # Exit at: 50%, 100%, 200%, 500%
takeProfits: [0.3, 0.25, 0.25, 0.2]       # Exit: 30%, 25%, 25%, 20%
```

**Analysis**:
- **50% gain**: Exit 30% → +15% locked profit
- **100% gain**: Exit 25% of remaining → +35% additional  
- **200% gain**: Exit 25% of remaining → +56% additional
- **500% gain**: Exit 20% of remaining → +60% additional

**Total if reaches 100%**: 15% + 35% = **+50% profit** ✅

### Strategy 2: Balanced Scalp (Recommended)
```yaml
multiplierPercents: [40, 80, 150, 400]     # Exit at: 40%, 80%, 150%, 400%
takeProfits: [0.25, 0.3, 0.25, 0.2]       # Exit: 25%, 30%, 25%, 20%
```

**Analysis**:
- **40% gain**: Exit 25% → +10% locked profit
- **80% gain**: Exit 30% of remaining → +40.5% additional
- **150% gain**: Exit 25% of remaining → +46.9% additional  
- **400% gain**: Exit 20% of remaining → +78.8% additional

**Total if reaches 80%**: 10% + 40.5% = **+50.5% profit** ✅
**Total if reaches 150%**: 10% + 40.5% + 46.9% = **+97.4% profit** ✅

### Strategy 3: Ultra-Conservative Scalp
```yaml
multiplierPercents: [25, 50, 100, 300]     # Exit at: 25%, 50%, 100%, 300%
takeProfits: [0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.2]         # Exit: 20%, 30%, 30%, 20%
```

**Analysis**:
- **25% gain**: Exit 20% → +5% locked profit
- **50% gain**: Exit 30% of remaining → +36% additional
- **100% gain**: Exit 30% of remaining → +84% additional
- **300% gain**: Exit 20% of remaining → +112% additional

**Total if reaches 50%**: 5% + 36% = **+41% profit** ✅

## Win Rate Analysis

### Current Strategy Requirements
- Need **70%+ tokens to reach 130%** to break even
- **High risk, high reward**

### Strategy 2 (Balanced) Requirements  
- Profitable at **40% gains** already
- **80% gains** give **50%+ profit**
- Only need **30% hit rate** at 80%+ to be very profitable

### Strategy 3 (Conservative) Requirements
- Profitable at **25% gains**
- **50% gains** give **40%+ profit**  
- Can be profitable with **60%+ hit rate** at just 25%

## Recommendation: Strategy 2 (Balanced Scalp)

**Why this works best**:
1. **Guarantees profit** on most positions that reach 40%+
2. **Excellent returns** on 80-150% moves (most memecoin gains)
3. **Still captures moonshots** with 20% remaining for 400%+
4. **Low break-even requirement** - only need 30% of trades to hit 80%

**Expected Results**:
- **60% of trades** hit 40%+ → **+10% each** → +6% total
- **40% of trades** hit 80%+ → **+50% each** → +20% total  
- **20% of trades** hit 150%+ → **+97% each** → +19.4% total
- **5% of trades** hit 400%+ → **+175% each** → +8.75% total

**Total Expected Return**: **+54% per cycle** with conservative assumptions

This strategy ensures profitability even with moderate memecoin performance while still capturing moonshots.
